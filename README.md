# ðŸ©º ML DOCTOR(Disease Prediction and Recommendation System)

This project is a **machine learning-based disease prediction system** with an integrated **Flask web application**.
It allows users to input their symptoms and get predictions about possible diseases, along with **precautions, medications, workouts, and diet recommendations**.

The system was first built in **Google Colab (IPYNB Notebook)** for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation, and later deployed using **Flask + HTML frontend (PyCharm IDE)**.

##   Features

*   Predicts diseases based on user-entered symptoms
*   Uses multiple ML classifiers (SVC, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, KNN, Naive Bayes)
*   Achieved **100% accuracy** on the test dataset
*   Flask-based web interface with `index.html` frontend
*   Provides:

  * Disease Description
  * Precautions
  * Medications
  * Recommended Workouts
  * Suggested Diets

##   Tech Stack

* **Python** (Flask, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Pickle)
* **Frontend**: HTML (Flask `render_template`)
* **ML Models Used**:

  * Support Vector Classifier (selected final model âœ…)
  * Random Forest
  * Gradient Boosting
  * K-Nearest Neighbors
  * Multinomial Naive Bayes

##  Model Training

1. Loaded dataset (`Training.csv`) with **4920 rows Ã— 133 columns**
2. Encoded labels (`prognosis`) using **LabelEncoder**
3. Split dataset: **70% training, 30% testing**
4. Trained multiple classifiers â†’ All achieved **100% accuracy** on test data
5. Final model chosen: **SVC (linear kernel)**
6. Model saved using **pickle (`svc.pkl`)**

##   Flask Web App

* Backend: `main.py` loads model + datasets and handles predictions
* Frontend: `index.html` form for user symptom input
* Output: Displays predicted disease, description, precautions, medications, workout & diet

Run locally:

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # (Linux/Mac)
venv\Scripts\activate     # (Windows)

 
# Run Flask app
python main.py
```
